 King<phrase role="actor"> Mahavish</phrase>
 belonged to <phrase>Ekshaku</phrase> clan. He earned the right to
 enter heaven being host to many ceremonies.
</para>
    
<para>
 Once Mahavish was invited to a party in heaven by none
 other than <phrase>Brahma</phrase> – the chief architect of  the universe. 
</para>
<para>
   
 Beautiful<phrase>
 Ganga</phrase> –  the goddess of the greatest river – was also present in Bramha's
 party. A gust of wind suddenly blew away Ganga's robe (the first recorded incidence
 of <emphasis>wardrobe malfunction</emphasis>). The gods averted their gaze, but Mahavish could
 not take his eyes off resplendent beauty of disrobed Ganga. 
</para>
<para>
 
   
 Brahma, angry with Mahavish,
 cursed him: <quote>You wretched man! Go away!! Go back to earth. You may return to heaven
 only after you lived a human life</quote>. Mahavish chose to be born on earth as
 <phrase>Shantanu</phrase>,
 son of King Prateep who came to be the emperor after seven generations from Kuru. 
</para>

<para>
 Ganga was returning to earth after the fateful party,
 Mahavish's admiring eyes still lingering in her mind. On her way back, she noticed
 a group of gods huddled at the wayside. She was curious.

<para xml:id="octobasus">
 The gods said: "We, eight
 of us, are <phrase>OctoBasus</phrase>. 
 Saint <phrase>Vashishta</phrase> had cursed
 us to human life. But we do not wish to enter a human womb. Will you please give
 birth to us?"
  
   
  Ganga agreed to OctoBasus' request.
   
 "Let us be born as sons of king Shantanu": OctoBasus suggested. 
   
 And they wished for more: "We are <emphasis>not</emphasis> looking forward to live entire human life.
 Human life sucks. Can you please throw us in the river as soon as we are born?"
   
 Ganga agreed, conditionally: "I can do that. But what about the king, my husband? 
 He would want
 at least one son from our union.  Won't he?". 
   OctoBasus said: "Let each of
 us contribute one-eighth of our sperm for a son. He can live and will be strong,
 but ... he will be infertile".
