<title>Curse of OctoBasu</title>

<para>
<phrase>Ganga</phrase> narrated the story of <phrase>OctoBasu</phrase>s 
and their curse:
</para>

 
 <blockquote>
 
 <para>
 Once OctoBasus and their wives went on a vacation to 
 <phrase role="place">Sumeru</phrase>
 mountain near Saint <phrase role="actor">Vashistha</phrase>'s meditation retreat. 
   </para>
   
   <para>
 The wife of
 <phrase role="actor">DuyBasu</phrase> – one of the OctoBasus – 
 saw <phrase role="actor">Nandini</phrase> – the
 amazing cow that granted every wish of its owner – grazing on the campus. 
 </para>
 
 <para>
 DuyBasu's
 wife liked the cow so much that she must gift it to 
 <phrase role="actor">Jitabati</phrase>, her
 friend.
</para>

<para>    
 She insisted husband so much that finally DuyBasu had to steal the cow.
 </para>
   
 <para>
 Saint Vashishta was not present 
 at the campus at that time. But once he returned and found the cow missing, he was
 furious. 
   </para>
   
   <para>
 He cursed: <quote>Whoever has stolen my Nandini will be born as human</quote>. 
   </para>
   
   <para>
 OctoBasu apologized and begged Saint Vashishta to retract his curse. 
   </para>
   
   <para>
 Vashishta calmed down a bit: 
 <quote>OK, you will be free of the curse within an year</quote>.
   </para>
   
   <para>
 <quote>But not him</quote>: Vashishta said, 
 pointing at DuyBasu: <quote>He must serve the sentence of a full human life. 
 But... it
 will be a pious life of a wise man who would be dear to his father
 and free from sexual temptation</quote>.
 </para>
 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 
 <para>
 After narrating the tale of
 of OctoBasus, Ganga told Shantanu: <quote>O my beloved king, I had thrown the newborns
 to the river every time because they were OctoBasus reincarnated, 
 and they wished to return to heaven as
 soon as possible. 
 But this eighth newborn is DuyBasu -– he must live a human man life 
 before he can enter heaven again</quote>. 
   </para>
   
   <para>
 Then she took the newborn with her and disappeared into Ganga -- her own river. 
 </para>
