After Ganga left him, Shantanu continued his reign. He was sad. Yet he remained a
 just ruler and spent his days free of lust or anger.

 After many years Ganga had
 left him, once Shantanu reached the riverbank chasing a deer on a hunt. 
 He noticed a  tall boy –
 handsome as god – was shooting arrows on the riverbank. The boy shot so rapidly that the
 sky was almost covered. Shantanu was impressed, but the boy soon disappeared.

 The mysterious
 boy reminded Shantanu of his own son whom he had never met since birth.

 The old king prayed
 to the river: <quote>O beloved Ganga, please let me see my son</quote>. 
 Ganga, beautiful
 and ageless, emerged from the river in a white dress.  The same tall boy was at
 her side.
