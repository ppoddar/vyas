		Vishma raised DhritaRashtra, Pandu
		and Bidur as if his own children. DhritaRashtra grew extraordinarily
		strong, Pandu became a master
		archer and Bidur was exceptionally pious.
	</p>
<p>
		Pandu was
		the obvious heir to the throne because Dhritarashta was blind and Bidur was a�shudra.
	</p>
<p>
		Vishma, in consultation with Bidur, arranged DhritaRashtra's�marriage
		to
		<span class="phrase">Gandhari</span>
		&#8211; the daughter of�
		<span class="phrase">Subol</span>
		--the�king
		of
		<span class="phrase">Gandhar</span>
		.
	</p>
<p>

		After her marriage to�a blind man, �Gandhari covered
		her eyes with a black bandage. �She did not want to supersede her husband by�any
		means.

	</p>
<p>


		<span class="phrase">Shur</span>
		was
		<span class="phrase">Basudev</span>
		's father and the
		leader of
		<span class="phrase">Yadu</span>
		�clan.
		Shur had a daughter, named
		<span class="phrase">Prithwa</span>
		.
	</p>
<p>

		Shur donated Prithwa to king
		<span class="phrase">KuntiBhoj</span>
		,
		his nephew, who was childless. Prithwa became known as
		<span class="phrase">Kunti</span>
		after the name of her adopted father.
	</p>
<p>

		Kunti once looked after Saint
		<span class="phrase">Durbasha</span>
		while the saint was a house guest at
		<span class="phrase">KuntiBhoj</span>
		's palace.
		<span class="phrase">Durbasha</span>
		was pleased and taught her
		a
		<span class="emphasis"><em>mantra</em></span>
		.

		"You can invite any god by this mantra. He will beget you a son": Durbasha
		told her.
	</p>
<p>

		Out of curiosity, young Kunti invited
		<span class="phrase">Surya</span>
		-- the Sun
		god.
	</p>
<p>

		Surya appeared and asked her: "O cat-eyed girl, what do you want?"
	</p>
<p>

		Kunti told
		him about Durbasha's mantra and apologized for her indiscretion.
	</p>
<p>

		Surya assured her:
		"Your invitation would not go waste. You will beget my son. But you will remain
		a virgin".
	</p>
<p>

		Kunti gave birth to an angelic son who was born with a body
		armor and ear-ring of a warrior. This firstborn of Kunti would later become
		famous
		as a great warrior
		<span class="phrase">Karna</span>
		.
	</p>
<p>

		But as a unwed mother, Kunti was ashamed. She secretly
		floated the newborn in the river on a pot.
	</p>
<p>
		<span class="phrase">Adhirath</span>
		and
		<span class="phrase">Radha</span>
		&#8211; a childless
		<span class="emphasis"><em>suta</em></span>
		couple &#8211;
		found�the baby floating
		in the river inside a pot and took the baby home.
	</p>
<p>

		They raised the baby like their
		own and named him
		<span class="phrase">BasuSen</span>
		.
	</p>
<p>

		BasuSen or
		<span class="phrase">Karna</span>
		, as
		he would be�known later, learned to handle all kinds of weapons as he grew up. Karna
		used to worship the sun till noon.
	</p>
<p>

		One day,
		<span class="phrase">Indra</span>
		&#8211; the god of
		the gods &#8211; came to him disguised as a brahmin.
	</p>
<p>

		Indra�asked Karna for his body armor.
		Karna took off the armor and gave it away.
	</p>
<p>

		Indra pleased by the�generous gesture
		donated Karna the
		<span class="phrase">Shakti Ashtra</span>
		&#8211; a weapon that never failed to
		kill the target and always returned to its owner.
	</p>
<p>


		KuntiBhoj organized Swamvar
		for her adopted daughter Kunti. Kunti chose
		<span class="phrase">Pandu</span>
		as her husband
		at Swambar.
	</p>
<p>

		Vishma, however, wanted another wife for Pandu. So Vishma went to King
		Shalya and asked for his sister.
	</p>
<p>

		Shalya said: "You must be aware
		of one of our customs. I can not ignore the customs, whether they are good or bad".
	</p>
<p>

		"There is no harm in following the customs": Vishma replied.
	</p>
<p>

		Vishma offered Shalya
		the dowry of gold, gems, elephants, horses.
		Shalya was pleased and offered his sister
		<span class="phrase">Madri</span>
		for marriage.
	</p>
<p>

		Vishma brought Madri to Hastinapur and married
		her to Pandu.
	</p>
<p>

		Shudra wife of King
		<span class="phrase">Debak</span>
		had a daughter from a bramhin's
		seed. Bidur was married to her.
